// Mods can define their own per-language string files.
// The values in a string file (such as en.txt) will add to
// and override any values in the base string file (such as Data\strings\en.txt).
// Each language supported should have its own string file named
// after the two-letter 639-1 language code for that language.
//
// A translation mod typically provides an entirely-new language instead of
// overriding or adding to the languages supported in the base game.
//
// Once a translation mod is enabled, the player should be able to select any
// language(s) added by the mod in the interface settings.
